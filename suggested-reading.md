There is no required textbook for the course, but the following books and lecture notes may be useful:
## CS 171
*	Course materials from [CS 171 - Spring 2024](https://eecs171.com/) (Undergraduate Cryptography). This is the precursor to our course, and we assume students are familiar with the content.
*   Katz and Lindell's textbook [Introduction to Modern Cryptography](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~mfy/moderncrypto/reading%20materials/Introduction_to_Modern_Cryptography.pdf) is written at an advanced undergraduate level and matches much of the curriculum from CS 171.

## CS 276
*	Course materials from a previous iteration of this course [CS 276 - Fall 2014](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sanjamg/assets/classes/cs276-fall14/)
